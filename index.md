I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the Catholic Bible, specifically, the bible stories from old testament and new testament. You may know better than me as I am a simple and ordinary catholic but I am so motivated to share with you what I read from the Holy Bible. It starts when I watched the *Amazing Love: The Story of Hosea*. This movie inspires me because I am utterly dumbfounded that I never knew Hosea before I watched the movie. 

Stay tuned for new posts, videos and podcasts.
